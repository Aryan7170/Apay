## 🎓 For Your Hackathon Submission

### Project Name

**CryptoSplit - Decentralized Bill Splitter**

### Tagline

"Split bills with friends using Ethereum. Trustless. Transparent. Simple."

### Description

```
CryptoSplit is a decentralized application for splitting bills with friends
using cryptocurrency. Traditional bill-splitting apps require trust in a
centralized service. CryptoSplit uses Ethereum smart contracts to provide
trustless, transparent, and verifiable bill splitting.

Features:
✅ Create bills and split between multiple people
✅ Track payments on-chain
✅ Withdraw collected funds
✅ Zero backend - completely decentralized
✅ Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)

Tech Stack:
- Smart Contracts: Solidity 0.8.20
- Testing: Foundry (Forge)
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Web3: ethers.js

All code is tested, documented, and ready for production.
```

### Demo URL

- Local: `http://localhost:8000` (after running `./setup.sh`)
- Live: Deploy to Vercel/Netlify + Sepolia testnet

### Video Demo

Record a 2-3 minute video showing:

1. Running tests (`forge test`)
2. Deploying contract
3. Creating a bill in the UI
4. Paying a share
5. Viewing transaction on Etherscan

### GitHub Repository

Make sure to include:

- ✅ Complete code
- ✅ README.md
- ✅ QUICKSTART.md
- ✅ License (MIT)

---

## 🎬 For Live Demo

1. Open terminal, run: `./setup.sh`
2. Open http://localhost:8000
3. Show:
   - Connect wallet
   - Create bill
   - Pay share
   - View on blockchain

**Total demo time: 3 minutes**

---

## 💡 Key Selling Points

1. **Solves Real Problem** - Everyone splits bills!
2. **Actually Works** - Complete, tested, deployable
3. **True Web3** - Decentralized, trustless, transparent
4. **Clean Code** - Well-structured, documented, tested
5. **Easy to Deploy** - One command setup

---

## 🚀 Optional: Deploy to Testnet (5 minutes)

```bash
# Get Sepolia ETH from faucet
# https://sepoliafaucet.com/

# Deploy
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol \
  --rpc-url https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY \
  --private-key YOUR_KEY \
  --broadcast

# Update frontend/app.js with contract address
# Deploy frontend to Vercel
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Submit to hackathon** - You're ready!
2. 📹 **Record demo video** - Follow DEMO_SCRIPT.md
3. 🌐 **Deploy to testnet** (optional) - More impressive
4. 📱 **Share on Twitter** - Get feedback

## 🐛 If Something Breaks

### Frontend won't connect

- Check MetaMask is installed
- Check you're on the right network (Localhost:8545, Chain ID: 31337)
- Check contract address in `app.js`

### Anvil not starting

- Kill existing: `killall anvil`
- Restart: `anvil`

### Tests failing

- Run: `forge clean && forge test`

### Transaction failing

- Check you have enough ETH
- Check you're using the right account
